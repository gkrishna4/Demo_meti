How we can connet the Ec2 instance with out using the pemfile?
=================================================================
1) Login into your instance with the .pem file
2) Update
3) sudo su
4) cd / (just incase)
5) Edit, vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config and edit or do the equivilent of uncommenting these lines:
Port 22
PasswordAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin yes
6) Restart sshd service, service sshd restart or systemctl restart sshd or equivilent
7) Set password, passwd
8) Log out and log back in without .pem file ssh root@<Ip-Address>

                                    (or)
in the Aws Ec2 console, select the instance and there we can have an opction called connect
click on connect---> it will navigate to the another page there we have an opction called Ec2-instance connect
when we click on that it will popup an notification there we can give the username and we click on the connect button
then automatically it will coonect to the ec2 instance.

How You can Create S3 Bucket?
==============================
Clickon AWS S3 --> Buckets --> Create Bucket --> and then configure the bucket like on which region you want to create 
Bucket type(automatically it will be General Purpose), Bucket Name( must be unic across all the regions ) and if you want
versioning on the Bucket, what we are creating, then we can enable it, By default it will be Disable, and then we can click on Create Bucket.
after creating the Bucket, under General Purpose we can find the bucket what we created, and from there also we can directly uplode the files.

How you can Access the S3 Bucket Objects what you created?
===========================================================
under the object/bucket what you created, you can find an option called permissions, there we can find an option called -->Block all Public Access is enabled
so we can disable it and save the changes, after that we can find an option called Bucket Policy---> click on Edit--> Policy Generator and then we can configure
S3 bucket policy, after generating the policy we can pasted over Bucket policy and save. and then we can access the objects we created.

What is Versioning in S3?
===========================
when you enable versioning in an S3 bucket, every time you make a change to a file, Aws automatically saves the previous version before storing the new one.
and it enable at the Bucket Level, and it has ability to restore a version, easy to rollback to previous version. 
Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version "null".
Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions.

Explain the diff b/w Buckets & Objects?
=======================================
In Amazon S3, data is stored in two main components: Buckets and Objects.
Buckets:
---------
- A Bucket is a container for storing objects. Each bucket has a unique name globally and is created in a specific AWS region.
- "Buckets can be configured with various settings like versioning, lifecycle policies, logging, and permissions. They can store an unlimited number of objects."
Objects:
--------
- an object is a data storage(The actual content you want to store, which can be anything from a text file to a video)retrieve it easily
- "Objects can be up to 5 TB in size and can be stored in different storage classes, each designed for various use cases and cost considerations. 
   Access to objects can be controlled using bucket policies, ACLs, and IAM policies."


How can you encryption data in S3?
=================================
SSE-S3(Server side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys ),
SSE-KMS(Server side encryption with Aws key Management Service keys), 
DSSE-KMS(Dual-layer Server side encryption with Aws key Management Service keys).

what is the Default Encryption in S3?
=====================================
Server side encryption(SSE-S3), is automatically to new Objects stored in the bucket. 

what is a VPC Endpoint for S3, and why it is use full?
=====================================================
A Vpc endpoint for s3 is like a privare, direct connection b/w your VPC and Amazon S3 that allows your resources(EC2 Instances)
to access S3 buckets without going over the public internet. this makes data transfers more secure, reduce the cost and and improves the performance
 
How would you troubleshoot slow S3 uplodes/Downlodes?
=====================================================
1) need to check with network Bandwidth, 
2) enable Transfor Acceleration, 
3) Use Multipart Uplode(recomended for files > 100MB and it seepup the transfor).

How do you ensure that only specific IAM roles can Access an S3 Bucket from a specific VPC?
===========================================================================================
use a combination of vpc endpoint policies and S3 bucket policies with conditions like ===> aws:SourceVpc

What is the difference between AWS config and AWS CloudTrail?
===============================================================
Config is focused on the configuration of your AWS resources and reports with detailed snapshots on how your resources have changed. 
CloudTrail focuses on the events, or API calls, that drive those changes. It focuses on the user, application, and activity performed on the system.

what is The difference between AWS CloudWatch and CloudTrail?
===============================================================
AWS CloudWatch monitors your AWS resources and applications, whereas CloudTrail monitors the activity in your AWS environment. 
For instance, with CloudWatch, you can scale your applications,whereas, with CloudTrail, you can see who did what to your applications.

what is Lamda?
===============
lamda is for automation purpose for the daily metrics, for supose we have one usecase is there like ENI triggers 
only so where ever the ec2 instance created, here some triggering will be happend after that instances are
created.
so most of the time application team can't take care that one, so for that, we did a small automation so if we
update one metric in the cloud watch & cloud trail. if any log is genarated, create an instance then automatically
cloud watch metric will be copied.

inside that we have lamda function and it featched the instance details and based on that it will created a tag
like application name,account_id etc based on featching.
so based on that it will create the tag and it will attached to that line
and lamda function will be written in python botto-3 for that manage.

What is NAT, Difference between Internet gateway & Nat?
============================================================
Nat is used for providing internet access to the private subnets and it allows only the outbound rules, if the instances present in the private subnet 
wants to downlode the something from the internet. 
Ex:- If i want to downlode some patchs from the internet, we configure the Nat Gateway for Private subnets it allows only OutBound internet connection
and also it does't ask public-IP's. So EC2 instances in private subnet with private-Ip using NAT and they can downlode somthing from internet.

InterNet GateWay
----------------
 Internet gateway is also used for internet access. internet gateway provides both inbound and outbound  internet connection, so here Internet Gateway provides 
inbound internet connection so here internet gateway commonly used in public subnets. so that the instances in public subnet with public ip they can access the internet


How to encrypt existing EBS(Elastic block Storage) volumes?
===========================================================
Here there is no direct opction to encrypt the EBS volumes!!!, So what we have to do here like, we can take any existing EBS volume to enable the encrypction.

>> First we take a snapshort from the existing Volume. After creating the snapshort, from that snapshort  we should create the volume, so while creating the 
volume we have an opction called Encryption-Check_Box, we can enable that check box and also we should use the master key for encryption
>> so once we create the volume we can go and attach that volume to ec2 instance


If EC2 instance reaches 100% CPU utilization, How to restart the EC2 instance Automatically?
==================================================================================================
By using cloud watch we can implement this...... so first we can go through the CLOUD-WATCH. From cloud-watch i can create the alaram on ec2 Instance.
So while creating the alaram ----> select the Metric
                                      ------> select EC2
                                                -------> Per-instance metrics
So Here  we can choose the instnce like CPU-Utilization, then after we can select the metric
                                                                            ------> Under static we can choose---> Maximum
                                                                            ------> period -------> 1 minute
Under condition --> i will give the CPU Utiliation is greterthen 90%
then afer under notification section we have an opction called EC2 Action
under this we have multiple opctions like
           >> Stop Instance
           >> Terminate Instance
           >> Reboot Instance
So here we can enable the opction called Reboot Instance
By using this we can automatically restart the EC2 Instance.



Difference between AMI and Snapshort?
=====================================
AMI is the complete EC2 backup, means it will backup all the vertual matchine a long with it's EBS volumes
Snapshort is just volume backup



What is High Avilability, How do you achive it in EC2?
======================================================
High avilability means making our application reachable, evean in case of failures
to achive this we can create our inatance accross the avilability zones. So that if any availability zone is fail the traffic is processed
to 2nd/3rd avilability zones



There are 3 VPC's "A", "B", "C". So here A is peered with B and B is peered with C, can "A" and "c" talk to eatch other?
========================================================================================================================
NO
Here vpc Peering does'nt support transitive peering.
So here A and C want's to communicate we should create a connection between A and  C



what is the difference between launch template and launch Configuration?
========================================================================
So we can find it in AutoScaling!!!!
>>  in the Launch configuration we can find NAME, AMI, Instance Type,  Opctions to purchase spot Instances, IAM Role, Storage, Securiry Group's & KeyPAir.
 So it is used for launching the EC2 Instance in autoscaling.

>> while creating the auto-scaling group, there we have an opction called create a Launch templet.
Here in the launch templet it will take more inputs. It can maintain the multiple versions, and here we have to choose an opction for On-Demand Instances
and SpotInstances. which is not available in the launch configuration.

>> and it support to choose multiple instance types in the same auto scaling group.

>> comming to the storage it has support for all the types of storages like io1, io2, gp1, gp2, sc1, st1 and magnetic.

>> But in the launch configuration it does'nt support all the storage types


Can we encrypt the EC2 Root Volume?
====================================
YES!!!
When ever we launching the instances, under add-Storage section we can find an opction called encryption, there we can find the opction to encrypt the volumes.


What is the difference between spot instance & Reserved Instance?
=================================================================
Reserved Instances:- Instances where we can give the long term commitment for 1 (or) 3 Years, and we can use these instances all the time 
                     in the day, week, month.
Spot Instances:- Spot instances are the instances allocated by aws from unlist capcity

Ex:- In a spcefic autoscaling group Amazon has lot of capacity deployed & all the capcity is not used, so here it has unused capacity, now amazon provides a way to use 
that unused capacity for cheaper cost. So here the Spot-Instance are very cheap we can get up to 90%OFF cost saving, when it commapared with ondemand instances,
but it is in downside.


For Spot instance we get an interruption occures, we want to stop instad of termination?
========================================================================================
when there is a spot intrapuction amazon issues a 2 minutes noties & after that i can eaither stop the instance (or) terminate the instance.
so here while launching the EC2 instance, under configure instance section we have an opction called  persistance request check box, we can can enable that one
then after it will show to option's like terminate instance then after it will show to option's like  terminate instance & stop instance here we can select the stop 
instance.


what are the lodeBalancers in the aws?
=======================================
Here in the AWS we have 3 types of lodebalancers
1) Application Lode Balancer will supports HTTP & HTTPS Protocals
2)Classic Lode Balancer Will supports Protocals like TCP,TSL, HTTP & HTTPS
3)Network Lode Balancer will supports TCP, SSL/TSL, UDP 


Have you Ever worked on LodeBalancers? and How?
=============================================== 
1)Application lode balancer-------->will supports HTTP & HTTPS Protocals
  >>it will support context path based routing(/app1, /app2, /usermgmt), HostBased routing
  >>support for routing based on fields in the request(HTTP Headers,HTTP Methods, Quary parameters and source ip address)
  >> support Redirecting one URL to Another 
  >>By seeing these features it not only a lode balancer, it is also a routing solution on the HTTP level
  >> support for containerized applications
  >> Support for Monitering the Helth of each service indipendently as health checks defind at the target group level
  
 Aws Application Lodebalancer can be provizened for K8S, using K8S ingress manifest.
 the ALB Ingress conroller supports two traffic modes
 1) Instance
 2) IP
 when we are using worker Nodes that means manged nodes in the EKS cluster by default we can use instance mode 
 when we are using farget only profile which means in your cluster really don't have any other node groups
  managed node groups like EC2 instances, we are just using the farget profile at that point of time, if we 
  want to use ALB then use only IP mode. 
 Instance Mode:
-----------------
>>Register nodes within your cluster as targets for ALB
>>here what ever the nodeport services we are going to create  infrent of our application Deployments, first ALB 
Routed to nodeport for your service and then nodeport service will routed to pods.

IP mode
-------
>> Register podes as targets for ALB
>> Traffic reaching the ALB is directly routed to pods for our service

classic lode balancer:
----------------------------
   Will supports Protocals like TCP,TSL, HTTP & HTTPS and its is legacy lodebalancer which is going to get depricated(remove) any time in the 
   newer feature came,in addition to that platforms like, as it is legacy also it will support EC2-clasic Environment & latest VPC Environment. so here in the 
   K8S, so when ever we create a service Object in K8S here the default LodeBalaner is create on the AWS is classic LodeBalancer.
   So here while create in the classic LodeBalancer in K8S for High Availability, for Example In a VPC we create a cluster control plane and also create the equalent
   public and private subnets in the availability zones,where we provided the cluster and there in the private subnets we created the nodes, and here the communication
   will be happen by using Natgate-Way and here the public access will be happend by the EKS-Control-plane. and in the public subnet we created the usermanagemet
   classic lodebalancer, so here when ever users try to access the application here the classic lode balancer will lodebalance the traffic.
