What is NAT, Difference between Internet gateway & Nat?
============================================================
Nat is used for providing internet access to the private subnets and it allows only the outbound rules, if the instances present in the private subnet 
wants to downlode the something from the internet. 
Ex:- If i want to downlode some patchs from the internet, we configure the Nat Gateway for Private subnets it allows only OutBound internet connection
and also it does't ask public-IP's. So EC2 instances in private subnet with private-Ip using NAT and they can downlode somthing from internet.

InterNet GateWay
----------------
 Internet gateway is also used for internet access. internet gateway provides both inbound and outbound  internet connection, so here Internet Gateway provides 
inbound internet connection so here internet gateway commonly used in public subnets. so that the instances in public subnet with public ip they can access the internet


How to encrypt existing EBS(Elastic block Storage) volumes?
===========================================================
Here there is no direct opction to encrypt the EBS volumes!!!, So what we have to do here like, we can take any existing EBS volume to enable the encrypction.

>> First we take a snapshort from the existing Volume. After creating the snapshort, from that snapshort  we should create the volume, so while creating the 
volume we have an opction called Encryption-Check_Box, we can enable that check box and also we should use the master key for encryption
>> so once we create the volume we can go and attach that volume to ec2 instance


If EC2 instance reaches 100% CPU utilization, How to restart the EC2 instance Automatically?
==================================================================================================
By using cloud watch we can implement this...... so first we can go through the CLOUD-WATCH. From cloud-watch i can create the alaram on ec2 Instance.
So while creating the alaram ----> select the Metric
                                      ------> select EC2
                                                -------> Per-instance metrics
So Here  we can choose the instnce like CPU-Utilization, then after we can select the metric
                                                                            ------> Under static we can choose---> Maximum
                                                                            ------> period -------> 1 minute
Under condition --> i will give the CPU Utiliation is greterthen 90%
then afer under notification section we have an opction called EC2 Action
under this we have multiple opctions like
           >> Stop Instance
           >> Terminate Instance
           >> Reboot Instance
So here we can enable the opction called Reboot Instance
By using this we can automatically restart the EC2 Instance.



Difference between AMI and Snapshort?
=====================================
AMI is the complete EC2 backup, means it will backup all the vertual matchine alsong with it's EBS volumes
Snapshort is just volume backup



What is High Avilability, How do you achive it in EC2?
======================================================
High avilability means making our application reachable, evean in case of failures
to achive this we can create our inatance accross the avilability zones. So that if any availability zone is fail the traffic is processed
to 2nd/3rd avilability zones



There are 3 VPC's "A", "B", "C". So here A is peered with B and B is peered with C, can "A" and "c" talk to eatch other?
========================================================================================================================
NO
Here vpc Peering does'nt support transitive peering.
So here A and C want's to communicate we should create a connection between A and  C



what is the difference between launch template and launch Configuration?
========================================================================
So we can find it in AutoScaling!!!!
>>  in the Launch configuration we can find NAME, AMI, Instance Type,  Opctions to purchase spot Instances, IAM Role, Storage, Securiry Group's & KeyPAir.
 So it is used for launching the EC2 Instance in autoscaling.

>> while creating the auto-scaling group, there we have an opction called create a Launch templet.
Here in the launch templet it will take more inputs. It can maintain the multiple versions, and here we have to choose an opction for On-Demand Instances
and SpotInstances. which is not available in the launch configuration.

>> and it support to choose multiple instance types in the same auto scaling group.

>> comming to the storage it has support for all the types of storages like io1, io2, gp1, gp2, sc1, st1 and magnetic.

>> But in the launch configuration it does'nt support all the storage types


Can we encrypt the EC2 Root Volume?
====================================
YES!!!
When ever we launching the instances, under add-Storage section we can find an opction called encryption, there we can find the opction to encrypt the volumes.


What is the difference between spot instance & Reserved Instance?
=================================================================
Reserved Instances:- Instances where we can give the long term commitment for 1 (or) 3 Years, and we can use these instances all the time 
                     in the day, week, month.
Spot Instances:- Spot instances are the instances allocated by aws from unlist capcity

Ex:- In a spcefic autoscaling group Amazon has lot of capacity deployed & all the capcity is not used, so here it has unused capacity, now amazon provides a way to use 
that unused capacity for cheaper cost. So here the Spot-Instance are very cheap we can get up to 90%OFF cost saving, when it commapared with ondemand instances,
but it is in downside.


For Spot instance we get an interruption occures, we want to stop instad of termination?
========================================================================================
when there is a spot intrapuction amazon issues a 2 minutes noties & after that i can eaither stop the instance (or) terminate the instance.
so here while launching the EC2 instance, under configure instance section we have an opction called  persistance request check box, we can can enable that one
then after it will show to option's like terminate instance then after it will show to option's like  terminate instance & stop instance here we can select the stop 
instance.


what are the lodeBalancers in the aws?
=======================================
Here in the AWS we have 3 types of lodebalancers
1)Application lode balancer,will supports HTTP & HTTPS Protocals
  >>it will support context path based routing(/app1, /app2, /usermgmt), HostBased routing
  >>support for routing based on fields in the request(HTTP Headers,HTTP Methods, Quary parameters and source ip address)
  >> support Redirecting one URL to Another 
  >>By seeing these features it not only a lode balancer, it is also a routing solution on the HTTP level
  >> support for containerized applications
  >> Support for Monitering the Helth of each service indipendently as health checks defind at the target group level
  
 Aws Application Lodebalancer can be provizened for K8S, using K8S ingress manifest.
 the ALB Ingress conroller supports two traffic modes
 1) Instance
 2) IP
 when we are using worker Nodes that means manged nodes in the EKS cluster by default we can use instance mode 
 when we are using farget only profile which means in your cluster really don't have any other node groups
  managed node groups like EC2 instances, we are just using the farget profile at that point of time, if we 
  want to use ALB then use only IP mode. 
 Instance Mode:
-----------------
>>Register nodes within your cluster as targets for ALB
>>here what ever the nodeport services we are going to create  infrent of our application Deployments, first ALB 
Routed to nodeport for your service and then nodeport service will routed to pods.

IP mode
-------
>> Register podes as targets for ALB
>> Traffic reaching the ALB is directly routed to pods for our service
2)Classic lode balancer
3)Network LodeBalancer, will supports TCP, SSL/TSL, HTTP & HTTPS

Have you Ever worked on LodeBalancers? and How?
=============================================== 
classic lode balancer:--- Will supports Protocals like TCP,UDP & TSL and its is legacy lodebalancer which is going to get depricated(remove) any time in the 
   newer feature came,in addition to that platforms like, as it is legacy also it will support EC2-clasic Environment & latest VPC Environment. so here in the 
   K8S, so when ever we create a service Object in K8S here the default LodeBalaner is create on the AWS is classic LodeBalancer.
   So here while create in the classic LodeBalancer in K8S for High Availability, for Example In a VPC we create a cluster control plane and also create the equalent
   public and private subnets in the availability zones,where we provided the cluster and there in the private subnets we created the nodes, and here the communication
   will be happen by using Natgate-Way and here the public access will be happend by the EKS-Control-plane. and in the public subnet we created the usermanagemet
   classic lodebalancer, so here when ever users try to access the application here the classic lode balancer will lodebalance the traffic.
