1) What is implicit cursor, explicit cursor? What are the cursor attributes?
	        |- cursor is a private sql memory area which is used to process multiple records & also this is a record by record process
	        |- All DB system having 2 types static cursors those are
		            |- Explicit cursor
		            |- implicit cursor	
	Explicit cursor:
		    |- for sql statement returns multiple records is called explicit cursur & also this is a record by record process
		       and also this memory area we can call it as Active set area.
	     Attributes:
	        	|- %no data found
		        |- %found
		        |- %is Open
		        |- %rowcount
	Implicit cursor:
		    |- For SQL statements returns single record is called implicit cursor, implicit memory area is also called as context area.
		    |- In oracle whenever pl/sql block having select into clause or pure DML statements then oracle server internally automatically
		       allocates the memory area is called as SQL area/context area/implicit cursor. 
		    |- this memory area always returns single record when pl/sql block having select into clause.
	   Attributes:
		    |- sql%no data found
		    |- sql%found
		    |- sql%is open
		    |- sql%rowcount.




2) What is a cursor for loop in PL/SQL?
	      |- Using cursor "for" loop we are eliminating explicit cursor life-cycle. i.e.. when ever we are using cursor for loop no need to
	         use open, fetch, close statements explicitly
	      |- when we are using cursor for loop oracle server only internally automatically open the cursor, and then fetch data from cursor
	         and close the cursor.... and it is used in Executable section of pl/sql block.
	      |- in cursor for loop index veriable internally behaves like a record type veriable(%rowtype).


  
	
3) What is a parameterized cursor in PL/SQL?
	      |- In Oracle we can also pass parameters to the cursor same like a subprogram "in" parameters. these parametes cursor are called as 
	         prameterized cursor.
      	|- in Prametarized cursor we are defining foral parameter when we are defining the cursor and also pass actual parameters when we are
	          open in the cursor.
	      |- in Oracle whenever we are defining the formal parameter in cursor/function/procedure then we are not allowd to use datatype size in
	         formal parameter declaration.




4) What is the difference between a strong refcursor and a weak refcursor in PL/SQL? 
	   |- Refcursor is a pointer to a query result set. These are two types: strong refcursor and weak refcursor.
     strong refcursor:
	          |- Predefined structure: The refcursor has a fixed return type defined at compile time (e.g., specific columns and data types).
	          |- Error checking: It’s safer because the compiler ensures that the cursor’s query matches the defined structure.
      weak refcursor:
	          |- Flexible structure: The refcursor can return any structure at runtime; it doesn’t have a fixed return type.
	          |- No error checking: The structure is checked only at runtime, so there’s more risk of mismatches.
 

	
5) What is the difference between a cursor and a refcursor in PL/SQL?
	            |- Cursor is static and fixed to one query, while refcursor is dynamic and can be used for multiple queries.
	            |- Cursor is local, whereas refcursor is flexible and reusable across different program units.


6) What is the difference between a cursor and a collection in PL/SQL?
	        |- Use a cursor when you need to fetch and process rows from a query directly.
	        |- Use a collection when you need to store data in memory for temporary storage, manipulation, or bulk processing.


7) When should you use a cursor, and when should you use a collection in PL/SQL?
	      |- Use cursors to fetch and process data directly from the database, especially when the dataset is large and you process it incrementally.
	      |- Use collections for in-memory storage and bulk processing when you want to work with data without repeatedly querying the database.


8) What is Dynamic Cursor(ref cursor) ? Diff between static cursor and dynamic cursor?
	    |- Ref Cursor: A pointer to a query result set, dynamic and reusable. Use it for flexible and modular programming.
		                 allowing the query to be defined at runtime, ideal for changing query requirements.
	    |- Static Cursor: Predefined and fixed, best when the query is constant.



9) Discuss the significance of cursor variables in PL/SQL?
	          |- Provide flexibility to handle dynamic queries at runtime.
	          |- Enhance reusability by being passed between program units.
	          |- Enable efficient result set management and resource control.
          	|- Support dynamic applications and improve modularity.
	          |- Simplify code maintenance by reducing the need for multiple static cursors.
