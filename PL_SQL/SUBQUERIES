1)What is subquery and explain its types?
	|- Subquerys are used to retrive the data from single or mutiple tables
	|- All DB systems having 2 types Sub-Querys and they are:
		|- Non-corelated Sub_Queries
			|- In Non_corelated SubQueries child queries are executed first then only parent quesries are executed. 
			   And these are clasified into 3 types they are
					|- single row subQuery
					|- multiple row subQuery
					|- multiple columns subQuery  
		|- Corelated Sub_Queries 
			|- In Corelated SubQuries parent queries are executed first then only chaild quaries are executed.
	
	|- Child Query: A query which provides values to the another query is called child query.
	|- Parent Query:A Query which receives values form another Query is called Parent Query.
	 


2) What is the difference between ROW_NUMBER, RANK & DENSE_RANK?
	|- Row_Number Analitical function automatically assigns different rank number when values are same
	|- Rank & Dense_rank analitical functions automatically assigns same rank numbers when values are same and also rank skips 
	   next consecutive number like(1,1,3,4,5)
	|- where as dence_rank doesnot skip next consecutive rank numbers.



	
3) What are SQL window functions? Explain it's types? 
	|- Analitical functions also similar to group function, genarally group function reduces no.of rows  in each group where as 
	  analitical functions doesn't reduces no.of rows in each group. i.e.. analitical function executes each and every group.
	|- Analitical functions must have "over clause" having 3 types of clauses
								|- partition by clause
								|- order by clause
								|- window frame clause.


4)When does a single-row subquery error occured?
	  |-A single-row subquery error occurs when:
		    |- No rows are returned (NO_DATA_FOUND).
		    |- More than one row is returned (TOO_MANY_ROWS).
 

5) what is ROWID?
	|- Rowid is an pseudo column, it behaves like a singlr column, Genarally here rownum having temporary values where as rowid having fixed values
	|- when ever we ar inserting data into table then oracle server automatically generates an unique identification number to identify the record 
	   uniquely this is called row_id.
	|- in oracle if we want to retrive the data very fastly by using row_id, by default rowid having ascending order. 


6)what is ROWNUM?
	|- Rownum is a pseudo column which behaves like a table colunm & it is used to restrict no.of rows in a table, where as when ever we are instaling 
 	   oracle server then automatically some pseudo columns are created in a data base. these pseudo columns are rownum, rowid... and rownum column is
	   also same as limit clause in Mysql database.
	|- Rownum is pseudo column which automatically assign no.to each row in a table at the time of selection
	|- genrally rownum doesnot work with more than 1 positive number. i.e.. it works with <, <= Oparators.
	|- here Rownum values are never pre-assigned. i.e rownum generates numbers at runtime based on where clause.  


7)Write an SQL Query delete duplicate records from a table?
	|- delete from TableName where rowid not in(select min(rowid) from TableName group by columnName);
		
      (or)

	|- DELETE FROM employees
	   WHERE (name, salary) IN (
   		 SELECT name, salary
    		 FROM (
        	    SELECT 
           		 name, salary,
            		 ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY name, salary ORDER BY employee_id) AS rn
        	    FROM employees
    		      )
   	         WHERE rn > 1
	     );


8)Write an SQL Query to display  nth highest salary?
	|- by using co-related sub Quary
		|- select * from emp e1 where &n=
		   (select count(distint(sal)) from  emp e2 where e2.sal>e1.sal);
	
	|- by using Analytical function
		|- select * from(select deptno, ename, sal, dence_rank() over(order by sal desc) r from emp) where r= &n;


	


9)find out 3rd and 4th highest salary?
	|- SELECT salary FROM (
    		SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
    		FROM employees
		)
		WHERE rnk IN (3, 4);

	(or)
	
	|- SELECT salary FROM (
    		SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM employees
    		ORDER BY salary DESC) OFFSET 2 ROWS FETCH NEXT 2 ROWS ONLY;




10)find out the latest one-month records?
		|- SELECT * FROM your_table
		   WHERE your_date_column >= ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, -1);



11) Write an SQL Query to display most recently joined employee in each department from emp table by using lead function?
	|- select * from (
	      select deptno, ename, hiredate, lead(hiredate) over(
	      partition by deptno order by hiredate) r from emp) where r is null;



12)Write an SQL Query to display 1st and last row from emp table?
	|- select * from (select rounum r, ename, sal from emp) where r=1 or r=(select count(*) from emp);



13) Write an SQL Query to display last 2 rows from emp table?
	|- select * from emp
	   minus
	   select * from emp where rownum <=(select count(*)-2 from emp);




14) Write an SQL Query to display the rows b/w  3 to 7 from emp table;
	|- select * from emp where rownum<=7
	   minus
	   select * from emp where rownum <= 3;
