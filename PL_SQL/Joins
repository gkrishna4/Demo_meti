1) Types of Joins.
	          |- Joins are used to retrive the data from multiple tables
	          |- In all databases if you are joining 'n' table then we are using (n-l) joining condition.
	      8i- Joins
		        |- Equi join/inner join
		        |- non-equi join
		        |- self join
		        |- outer join
	      9i- Joins
		        |- INNER JOIN
		        |- LEFT OUTER JOIN,
		        |- RIGHT OUTER JOIN
		        |- FULL OUTER JOIN
		        |- NATURAL JOIN




		
2) Differentiate between INNER JOIN, LEFT OURTER JOIN,RIGHT OUTER JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, NATURAL JOIN? When to use each of these join?
		      |- INNER JOIN:
			            |- this join also returns matching rows only, here also join conditional colunm must belongs to the same type. 
			               when tables having common column then only we are allowd to use inner join. here inner join performance is very high 
			               compare to oracle 8i equi join
			            |- using clause:
				                |- in 9i joins we can also use "using clause" in place of "on clause"  genarally using clause performance very high
				                   compare to on clause and also "using clause" returns common column one time only
				                |- when ever we are using "using clause" then we are not allowed to use alias name in joining condition.

		    |- LEFT OUTER JOIN:
			            |- This join always returns all rows from the left side and matching rows form the right side table & also returns 
		                 null values inplace of non-matching rows in another table.
		    |- RIGHT OUTER JOIN
			            |- This join always returns all rows from the right side and matching rows form the left side table & also returns 
		                  null values inplace of non-matching rows in another table.
		    |- FULL OUETRT JOIN
			            |- this join returns all rows from all tables becouse it is a combination of left, right- outer joins.
			            |- this join also returns null values in place of non matching rows in another table.
		    |- Natural Join
			            |- this join also returns matching rows only, this join performance is very high compare to inner join.
			            |- in this join we are not requred to use joining condition explicitly. but inthis case resource tables must have  
			               a comman column name based on this common  column oracle server only internally automatically establishes joining condition.
			            |-  when ever we are using natural join oracle server always returns common column one time only because natural join'		
			                internally use using clause.
			            |-  when ever we using natural join also then we are not allowed to use alias name to joining conditional column, because
			                natural join internally uses using clause.
