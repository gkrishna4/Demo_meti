git add -->>To add files from working directory to staging area. 
git commit -->> To commit changes from staging area to local repository. 
git push -->> To move files from local repository to remote repository.
git clone -->> To create a new local repository from the remote repository. 
git pull -->> To get updated files from remote repository to local repository.

what is a git snapshot?
========================
when you COMMIT, you save your current repository's current working directory as a new snapshot(commit= snapshot + metadata)
your git repository consists of series of snapshot's

Creating a new remote repo now
===============================
Open the page
https://github.com/new
There define a name for your repository
Click on Create Repository button
You will landed on to Repository Page, copy the HTTPS based link of that repository
Go to your local repo on VM
Let's check the remote references

1) git remote: 
We can use git remote command to configure remote repository to our local repository.  
$ git remote add <alias_name>  remote_repository_url 
 
Eg:     $ git remote add origin https://github.com/durgadevops88/github_project.git 
 
Note:-
Here, origin is alias name of the remote_repository_url. By using this alias name only we 
can communicate with remote repository. Instead of origin we can use any name, but it is convention to use origin. 

$ git remote 
   It just provides the alias names of remote repositories 
$ git remote -v 
   It provides remote repository urls also.

Let's add the remote reference now

git remote add origin paste_the_link_you_copied

Now check the remote reference, you will see the reference now

git remote -v

2) git push: 
We can use git push command to send our changes from local repository to remote 
repository.
            syntax:-   git push <remote_name>  <branch_name>  
            Eg:-          git push origin master 


Creating Personal Access Tokens
===============================
Open the page
https://github.com/settings/profile
Scroll down, in the left pane look for Developer Settings, click on that
Click on Personal Access Tokens , in the left pane
Click on Generate new token
Provide a name, and click the checkbox along with repo over to provide repo push access
Now click on Generate Token button at the bottom
Copy the token generated and keep it safe  token------>  (  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  )
Go to local repo on VM 

let's push the code
--------------------
git push origin master

It will prompt you for username and password, just provide them. Remember, for password,
you need to provide Personal Access Token which you generated right now


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**0) Difference between SVN  and GIT?

Git and SVN are  version control systems where as Git is a distributed version control system, 
and SVN is a centralized version control system.

GIT:
----
The name itself indicates the respository is distributed and every developers workspace contains a local copy of the repository. 
# There is no question of central repository.

for example If we have 4 developers are there then 4 repositories will be there.

1) So Here when we are performing the  checkout and commit operations locally,performance is more.
and also network is not required. if there is any network outage, still version control is applicable. 

3) for example if something goes wrong to any repository there is a chance to recover. There is no question of single point of failure. 

4) And To perform push and pull operations network must be required, but these operations are not most common operations and we are performing very rarely.

Note:
------
 1) commit and checkout operations will be performed between workspace and repository. 
  work space – commit --> Repository 
 Repository – checkout--->workspace

2) push and pull operations will be performed between repositories. 
  one repository ---push --->other repository 
  one repository<--pull----other repository


Here are some .git directory structures used in GIT:

HEAD/: A pointer structure used in git.
Config/: Contains all configuration preferences.
description/: Description of your project.
index/: It is used as a staging area between working directory.
object/: All the data are stored here.
logs/: Keeps record to change that are made.

SVN: 
===
The name itself indicates that, this type contains only one central repository and every developer should be connected to that repository. 
The total project code will be stored in the central repository. 
If 4 developers are there, still we have only one repository

This type of VCS 
-----------------
Eg: CVS, SVN, Perforce, TFS, Clearcase etc

Problems with Centralized VCSs:
---------------------------------
1) Central Repository is the only place where everything is stored, which causes single point of failure.
   If something goes wrong to the central repository then recovery is very difficult.


2) All commit and checkout operations should be performed by connecting to the central repositoty via network.
   If network outage, then no version control to the developer. i.e in this type, 
   developer work space and remote repository server should be connected always.


3) All commit and checkout operations should be performed by connecting to the central repositoty via network 
   and hence these operations will become slow, which causes performance issues. No local operations and every version control operation 
   should be remote operation.


4) Oranization of central repository is very complex, if number of developers and files increases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)what  is git ?

✽ Git is Distributed Version Control System Tool. 
✽ GIT is developed by Linus Torvalds(Finnish software engineer), who also developed Linux Kenel. 

=================================================================================================
1.i)when you use  --amend and what is the use of it?

"git commit --amend" is a command used to modify the most recent commit. it's like an 'undo' and 'recommit'. Allowing you to fix mistackes
with out creating a new commit.
Example:-
Fix the Typos in commit messages: -----------> git commit --amend -m "corrected message"
Add missed changes(stage the forgotten files):------> git commit --amend --no-edit

1.ii) Which branching Strategy?

Ans: GitHub Flow


==================================================================================================
2)Difference between the Git and GitHub?

Git is a mechanisam and GitHub is a implementation software 
 
Git is a version control system. So you manage and keep track of your source code history. 

GitHub is a cloud-based Git Server where Remote repositorys will be maintained in Cloud environment 

=================================================================================================
3)Full form of VCS

version controlling system
=================================================================================================
4) Full form of SCM

source code management 

=================================================================================================
5)write the 5 SCM names?

>>Bitbucket
>>GIT
>>GITLAB
>>GITHUB
>>Helix Core Version Control
>>Subversion(SVN)
>>Team Foundation Server (TFS)
 
=================================================================================================
**6)what is Branch?

A Branch is nothing but an independent flow of development and by using branching concept, we can create multiple work flows.

master branch is the default branch/ main branch in git. Generally main source code will be placed in master branch.
Based on our requirement, we can create any number of branches.

Need of creating a New Branch:
---------------------------------------------
Assume we required to work on new requirements independently, then instead of working in the master branch, 
we can create a seperate branch and we can work in that branch, related to that new requirement without affecting main branch.

How to Create a New Branch: 
---------------------------------------
We can create a new branch by using ------->    git branch command. 
Syntax:
--------- 
              git branch brach_name

How to Switch from one Branch to another Branch?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
git checkout brach_name


Short-cut Way to Create a New Branch and switch to that Branch:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We have to use -b option with checkout command.
--->git checkout -b new2branch
Switched to a new branch 'new2branch'


how do we push the new branch to the gitHub
----------------------------------------------

git push --set-upstream origin BranchName

=================================================================================================
7)what is Tag?

**In general Tags can be used for release verions.

In our repository there may be a chance of multiple commits. HEAD/Branch is always pointing to latest commit 
and its value keep on changing when new commits happend. So here Tag is nothing but a Label to a particular commit in our repository.
Tag is static and permanent reference to a particular commit where as HEAD/Branch is a dynamic reference.

Create a tag
------------
git tag <tag-name>

All tags information will be stored in .git/refs/tags/ folder.

delete a tag
------------
We have to use git tag command with -d or --delete option.
git tag -d <tagname>

to see number of tags we have
------------------------------
git tag --list

===============================================================================================
how to tag a previous commit?

Sometimes we may forgot to tag a particular commit. It is possible to tag for previous 
commits.
$ git tag -a <tagname> <commitid> -m <tagmessage>

=================================================================================================
what is annotated tags?

Annotated Tag is exactly same as tag, except that it maintains information like 
tagger name, date of creation, description etc.

Annotated tags will be stored in .git/refs/tags folder and .git/objects folder.

We can create annotated tag by using git tag command with -a option.
$ git tag -a <tagname>
 Here -a indicates that it is annotated tag.
 
$ git tag -a <tagname> -m <tag_message>

=================================================================================================
8)what is the difference between the TAG and BRANCH?

Branch always points to the top of a development line and will change when a new commit is pushed.
Where as a tag will not change. Thus tags are more useful to "tag" a specific version

=================================================================================================
9)When we create the tag?

Git tags are used as reference points in your development worflow. 
you might want to create new Git tags in order to have a reference to a given release of your software.

=================================================================================================
10)what is git add Command?

To add files from working directory to staging area for tracking purpose, we have to use git add command.

=================================================================================================
11) What is the command to revert the code from staging area to working area?

$ git checkout -- file1.txt 
It will discard any unstaged changes made in file1.txt.
 After executing this command, staged copy content and working directory content is same.

Summary: 
--------------- 
git checkout -- file.txt   --->>To discard changes in working directory copy.
git checkout    --->>>To discard changes in all tracked files of working directory.
git checkout ---->>>If we are not passing any argument, then this command will show the list of eligible files  for checkout.
=================================================================================================
**12) What is the difference between featch and pull in GIT?

featch-->> To get updated files from remote repository to local repository.from there we can update the files in to the working copy.

        After fetching updates from the remote repository, you can inspect the changes using commands like git log or git diff to see 
        the differences between your local and remote branches. If you're satisfied with the changes and want to incorporate them into
         your current working branch, you can use git merge or git rebase to apply those changes.

         For example, to merge the changes fetched from the remote origin/main branch into your current local branch:
                      git merge origin/main
          Or, if you prefer to rebase your changes on top of the remote updates:
                      git rebase origin/main
         After merging or rebasing, you can then continue working with the updated files in your local working directory.
         Remember to commit your changes when you're done with your modifications.

pull-->> insted of featch and update....if we do pull it will update changes done in remote repository  to local repository
         and also update working copy/actual copy(here we no need of featch  saparately.....pull only internally performs  featch oparation) 
         pull=featch+update
=================================================================================================

13) How to delete the branch?

Once we completed our work we can delete the branch. 
Deletion of the branch is optional. 
The main objective of deleting branch is to keep our repository clean. 
We can delete a branch by using git branch command with -d option.

Syntax:
------------
 $ git branch -d <branch_name>

=================================================================================================

14) what is git squash command?

If we want to combine all commits of feature branch into a single commit and merge that commit to the master branch, 
then we should go for squash option.

git merge --squash feature
================================================================================================
what is merging?

for example created a branch to implement some new feature and we did some new changes in 
that branch, once work completed we have to merge that branch back to parent branch.

We can perform merge operation by using git merge command.
We have to execute this command from parent branch.

Assume new feature implemented properly, We want to merge feature branch with 
master branch.

$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'

$ git merge feature

=================================================================================================

15) what does git rebase?

You are working on "feature-branch", but "main" has new updates. You want to update your branch with the latest main changes.
Step-by-Step Process:
---------------------
# Step 1: Switch to the feature branch
git checkout feature-branch  

# Step 2: Fetch the latest changes
git fetch origin  

# Step 3: Rebase the feature branch onto main
git rebase main  

Your commits are now on top of the latest main.

Handling Conflicts During Rebase
=================================
When you run git rebase main, Git reapplies your commits on top of the latest main. If any commit modifies the same file as in main, a conflict occurs.
Git will pause and ask you to fix it.

Steps to Fix a Rebase Conflict
-------------------------------
Identify the Conflict and RUN the command: git status  
You'll see:---- both modified: file.txt files
This means file.txt has changes from both your branch and main.


Open the Conflicted File----->Manually Fix the Conflict---->Mark the Conflict as Resolved.

After fixing the file, stage the changes:-- git add file.txt
Continue the Rebase:--  git rebase --continue

Git will reapply the next commit. If there are more conflicts, repeat the process.

If things go wrong, you can abort(cancel) the rebase and return to the original state:---   git rebase --abort
NOTE:
=====
✅ Conflicts happen when changes overlap
✅ Fix them manually, stage, and continue rebase




=================================================================================================

16)what is git stash command?

The git stash command takes our uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves in some temporary location.
After completing our urgent work, we can bring these stashed changes to our current working directory.

Note: 
--------
1. Stashing concept is applicable only for tracked files but not for newly created files.
2. To perform stashing, atleast one commit must be completed.


How to perform unstash? 
We have to bring files from temporary location to our working directory. For this we have to perform unstash operation. 
We can perform unstashing in 2 ways:
1. by using git stash pop 
2. by using git stash apply

1. by using git stash pop: 
---------------------------------
git stash pop stash@{0}
It will bring stashed changes from temporary location to working directory. The corresponding entry will be deleted.

2. by using git stash apply:
-----------------------------------
 git stash apply stash@{0}
It will bring stashed changes from temporary location to working directory. But, the corresponding entry won't be deleted, 
so that we can use this stash in other branches to continue their work.


and we can see list of available stashes by uisng the command 
$git stash list

to delete the all stashs
$git stash clear

to delete the perticular stash
$git stash drop stashID

=================================================================================================

17)what is git cherry-pick?

Assume that we have two branches are there like master and feature. If we merge feature branch to the master branch, 
then all commits and the corresponding changes will be added to master branch. Insted of all commits, 
we can pick an arbitraty commit of the feature branch and we can append that commit to the master branch. It is possible by using cherry-pick command.

Use cases of cherry-pick:
---------------------------------
 1. Cherry-pick allows to share code between branches
 2. We can use for bug hot fixes. Assume that a developer has started working on a new feature. 
    During that new feature development he identify a pre-existing bug. The developer creates an explicit commit patching this bug. 
   This new patch commit can be cherry-picked directly to the master branch to fix the bug before it effects more users.

Note:
=====
1. When ever we are using cherry-pick command, a brand new commit object will be created but with same changes of the picked commit of feature branch.
2. Cherry-pick may cause duplicate commits and hence in most of the scenarios we can use merge operation instead of cherry-pick.
3. We can use -n or --no-commit option with cherry-pick, in that case new commit won't be created. This is helpful whenever we are doing cherry-picking 
   multiple commits. With all these changes we can create a single commit.

$ git checkout master
$ git cherry-pick -n commitid1
$ git cherry-pick -n commitid2
$ git cherry-pick -n commitid3
$ git add .;git commit -m 'single commit for multiple cherry-pick options'
-----------------------------------------------------
Let's say we have a scenario where we're working on a web application with multiple branches: master, development, and feature/authentication.
Scenario:
==========
We're developing a new feature on the feature/authentication branch, implementing a user authentication system.
Meanwhile, a critical security vulnerability is discovered in production that requires immediate attention.
We need to fix the vulnerability on the master branch without merging the entire feature/authentication branch.

Explanation:
============
Identify the commit containing the fix:
We identify the specific commit on the feature/authentication branch that fixes the security vulnerability.

Cherry-pick the fix onto master:
-----------------------------------
We use git cherry-pick to apply only the fix commit onto the master branch.
git checkout master
git cherry-pick <commit-hash-of-security-fix>

Resolve conflicts if any:
-----------------------
If there are conflicts between the fix commit and changes on the master branch, we resolve them by manually addressing the conflicts.

Verify and deploy:
------------------
Once the cherry-pick is successful and conflicts are resolved, we verify that the fix works as expected on the master branch.
Finally, we deploy the fix to production, ensuring the security of our application.

Why git cherry-pick?
-------------------
git cherry-pick allows us to selectively apply specific commits from one branch to another.
In this scenario, it enables us to address a critical security issue without merging the entire feature branch, keeping the master branch
stable and ensuring that only the necessary changes are deployed to production.

Summary:
git cherry-pick is a valuable tool in scenarios where we need to apply specific commits to a different branch without merging the entire
branch. It helps maintain code integrity and allows us to respond swiftly to urgent situations while keeping development efforts focused
and organized.
=================================================================================================
18)what is PAT?

Personal access tokens (PATs) are an alternative to using passwords for authentication to GitHub when using the GitHub API or the command line. 
If you want to use a PAT to access resources owned by an organization that uses SAML SSO, you must authorize the PAT.

=================================================================================================
19)what is Git reset?
  It is opposite to git add command. 
  There are 2 utilities of git reset command. 
         Utility-1: To remove changes from staging area 
         Utility-2: To undo commits at repository level

Utility-1: To Remove Changes from staging Area
------------------------------------------------
We can use git reset to remove changes from staging area. 
Changes already added to staging area, but if we don't want to commit, then to  remove such type of changes from staging area,
then we should go for git reset. It will bring the changes from staging area back to working directory. 

git rm --cached  vs git reset: 
-------------------------------
git rm --cached file1.txt 
    The file will be removed completely from staging area. 
git reset file1.txt 
    The file won't be removed from staging area, but reset to previous state(one step back). 

Q) We modified the content of the file1.txt and added to staging area. But we want to ignore those changes in staging area 
and in working directory. For this requirement which commands we required to use? 
=================================================================================
 
git reset file1.txt 
     To ignore changes in staging area 
git checkout -- file1.txt 
     To ignore changes in working directory 

Utility-2: To undo Commits at Repository Level 
==============================================
We can also use reset to undo commits at repository level. 

Syntax: git reset <mode> <commitid> 
    Moves the HEAD to the specified commit, and all remaining recent commits will be removed. 
    mode will decide whether these changes are going to remove from staging area and working directory or not. 
 
    The allowed values for the mode are: 
        --mixed 
        --soft 
        --hard 
        --keep 
        --merge 
1) --mixed Mode: 
It is the default mode. 
To discard commits in the local repository and to discard changes in staging area we should use reset with --mixed option. 
It won't touch working directory. 


2) reset with --soft Option: 
It is exactly same as --mixed option, but changes are available in working directory as well as in staging area. 
It won't touch staging area and working directory. 
As changes already present in staging area, just we have to use commit to revert back. 
Use Cases:
-----------
    1) If some files are missing in the last commit, then add those files and commit again. 
    2) We forgot to add defect number in commit message. 

3)reset with --hard: 
It is exactly same as --mixed except that Changes will be removed from everywhere (local repository,staging area,working directory) 
It is more dangerous command and it is destructive command. 
It is impossible to revert back and hence while using hard reset we have to take special care. 

Importent Topic-13: Git References (master and HEAD)
=====================================================

Find out who made which changes to a file in Git — even when multiple people have been working on the same file for days?
============================================================================================================================
✅ 1. Use git blame (Most Common & Real‑Time Tool)
         This shows who last modified each line of a file.
               Syntax:- git blame <filename>
               example: git blame app.py

              Output (example):
             -------------------
                     f32a1e2f (Rama 2024-02-21 15:22:10) def login():
                     c17d9a5b (Krishna 2024-02-22 10:42:51)     return "success"
            This tells you:
            ---------------
            1)The commit hash
            2)Author name
            3)Date
            4)The exact line they changed
            ✔ Perfect for seeing line‑by‑line ownership
            ✔ Used heavily in code reviews/debugging


Verify the installation by checking the version
=================================================

git --version

To set the intial user config
===============================
git config --global user.name "YOUR_NAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"


To use a different name/email address for a perticular project,change it inside the project
        ----> change the directory to respective  repository
               
             ----> git config user.name "ramakrishna"
             ----> git config user.email "gantaramakrishna999@gmai.com"
 
Note:- here we should not use --global ,if we use --global it will change in all repositorys 


Now, let's verify this inital config
--------------------------------------

git config --global -l


Create a empty directory
------------------------

mkdir repo1

cd repo1

Initialise repo
------------------
git init

      -->ls -la
           here we can find --> .git
      --> cd .git
            here we can find -->config file
      --> cat config
             in this config file we can find -----> [remote "origin"]
             
             [remote "origin"] ---> it will tell, to which Distributed repository does it  communicate 
       
                               
Check repo status
-----------------
git status

Create some file in the directory
----------------------------------
vi somefile

Check repo status, it will say something about Untracked files
---------------------------------------------------------------
git status

Let's add the file to staging area
----------------------------------
git add somefile

Check repo status, it will say "Changes to be commited"
------------------------------------------------------
git status

Commit it
----------
git commit -m "First Commit"

Check repo status, it will say "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
git status

Check the commit history
------------------------
git log

Let's make a small change to the file
--------------------------------------
vi somefile

Check repo status, it will say "Changes not staged for commit"
---------------------------------------------------------------
git status

Let's add the file to staging area
------------------------------------
git add somefile

Check repo status, it will say "Changes to be commited"
--------------------------------------------------------
git status

Commit it
----------
git commit -m "Second Commit"

Check repo status, it will say "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
----------------------------------------------------------------------
git status

Check the commit history
-------------------------
git log





I have some code in Bit bucket how do you get it to GitHub?
===========================================================

https://www.devopsschool.com/blog/how-to-move-repository-from-bitbucket-to-github-with-all-branches-and-commits/



Step 1 : Create a Blank repository on Github without Readme.md

Step 2 : Moving all code and content from bitbucket
       
        1. Check out the existing repository from Bitbucket:
           $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:Cotocuschandan/testrepo.git
        2. Now adding new GitHub Repository as upstream remote of the repository which is clone from bitbucket.
            $ cd testrepo
            $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:devops-school-com/ds-test.git
       3. push all branches and tags to GitHub Repository using below commands
             $ git push upstream master
            $ git push --tags upstream

Step 3 : Add URL of New Github Repository as redirect URL
           $ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:devops-school-com/ds-test.git

Step 4: At last Clone all branches and tags to GitHub Repository
          $ git push --mirror


why we need to use repositories such as nexus or Docker hub, since we have already Git /Bitbucket/svn?
=======================================================================================================
Git/Bitbucket/svn is a source referential for version control (with features like merging, branching, tags)

Nexus/Docker-Hub is an artifact referential for any delivery.
simply a collection of shared directories with a naming convention ( group.artifact.version ).




how do we create the permissions to the devlopers over the branches in github
